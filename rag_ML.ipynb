There are several reasons for this: First, transparency may reduce the efficiency of policy outcomes. When the public is aware of the details of the decision, decision makers may be pressured to maintain certain positions or claim additional benefits. This can complicate decision-making, increase its duration, and reduce its flexibility. This may lead to less quality, less comprehensive or less stable agreements. Second, transparency may reduce decision makers' ability to reach agreement in the first place. When policy options are disclosed, the number of acceptable options for decision makers may decrease. This is because the public may reject, criticize, or oppose certain options. Consequently, it may become difficult for decision makers to move away from their initial positions or prejudice certain interests. This may reduce bargaining space and increase the risk of stalemate or failure. Third, transparency may increase the use of public commitment strategies. These are strategies in which decision makers publicly and openly state their negotiating positions, with a view to strengthening their position or undermining others' position. This increases transaction costs resulting from changing, modifying, or reversing these positions. This reduces decision makers' incentives for cooperation, consensus, or central solutions. This increases the likelihood of conflict, division, or breakdown. Based on these reasons, it can be said that transparency is not always useful. Sometimes they can be an obstacle or a danger to achieving the desired goals. There must therefore be a balance between transparency and confidentiality, and the appropriate level of transparency must be chosen for each case, depending on the circumstances (Hagemann, Franchino 2016, p.3). The European Union's decision-making studies indicate that there are several factors affecting the efficiency of these processes, including the distribution of preferences and voting rules. The majority vote is known to tend to take decisions faster than the unanimous rules (Golub, 2007). Some studies have found that the European Parliament's involvement slows decision-making, even in cases where it has only an advisory role. While some find that the enlargement of the European Union accelerates the decision-making process, others see it as slowing down, and there are those who find little impact. Thus, it appears that multiple factors play a role in the efficiency of decision-making in the European Union, and understanding these factors can help improve decision-making processes and enhance administrative and political effectiveness within the European Union. In addition to known factors affecting the European Union's decision-making processes, some studies focus on other manifestations of political complexity that are not linked to the number of member States in the Council of Ministers or the institutional role of the European Parliament (Dru ̈ ner et al. For example, a study showed that long acquisitions depend not only on choosing one of the options available, but also on finding a solution at the initial stage. A study also noted that different forms of political disagreement had a strong impact on the duration of negotiations (Brandsma 2015). In the same vein, a study has shown that stakeholders' participation in the legislative drafting phase could prolong decision-making processes, arguing that consultations increase the cost of transactions for subsequent negotiation, affecting the duration of legislative processes (Rasmussen and Toshkov 2013). In addition, although transparency has not emerged as a direct determinant of decision-making, some studies suggest that decision-making processes can be influenced by the extent to which surveillance and social narratives of these processes exist within the Cabinet (Stasavage 2004). It is important to note that these studies highlight the complexities of EU decision-making, which includes not only direct political factors, but also social and institutional aspects that play a role in shaping and impacting these processes. There seems to be a strong belief among decision makers that transparency negatively affects decision-making efficiency. In this sense, they resist external pressure that seeks to increase levels of transparency, considering that institutions need \"space for reflection\" without external interference or pressure. But we must wonder whether this belief is based on concrete and scientific evidence? Does transparency actually affect decision-making, as decision makers believe? On the other hand, the use of transparency can sometimes be strategic by decision makers, as it can be used as a means to engage in negotiations and accelerate them rather than slow them down. Thus, there seems to be a discrepancy in how transparency affects the decision-making process, and it cannot be asserted that it always affects negatively. But in fact, to better understand the relationship between transparency and decision-making efficiency, more thorough research is needed. In fact, the relationship between them is very complex and demonstrates or denies how accurately and scientifically transparency affects. Through these studies, we can determine whether or not the beliefs among decision makers are correct and develop effective strategies to improve decision-making in the current context. It also serves as a channel for citizenship participation in this process, where individuals can express their views and observations directly and effectively. In Curtin and Meijer’s exploration of the linkages between these ideas, they suggest that greater transparency leads to social acceptance of the policy-making structures and that this – in turn – leads to greater input legitimacy (Curtin and Meijer, 2006; Scharpf, 2009). This would seem to indicate that, despite an increase in both formal and informal ties operating at the institutional level (Egeberg et al., 2014), some inter-institutional enmity remains among the individual actors involved. Although there has been this evolution in the trend towards greater transparency in the Council, this does not necessarily mean that there is a direct correlation between transparency and the efficiency of the Council's decision-making process. In fact, some research suggests that transparency may reduce the efficiency of decision-making, as it can complicate and slow processes as a result of increased public debate and debate. However, transparency can also promote democracy and accountability, as the public can demand more details of decision-making processes and leaders' positions. While some studies have concluded that transparency may reduce the efficiency of decision-making, others see it as contributing to its improvement.\n"
